There is now a server AMI for WebPageTest for quickly spinning up a private instance.

* us-east-1: [ami-fcfd6194](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-fcfd6194)
* us-west-1: [ami-e44853a1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-e44853a1)
* us-west-2: [ami-d7bde6e7](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-d7bde6e7)
* sa-east-1: [ami-0fce7112](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=sa-east-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-0fce7112)
* eu-west-1: [ami-9978f6ee](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-9978f6ee)
* eu-central-1: [ami-22cefd3f](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-central-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-22cefd3f)
* ap-southeast-1: [ami-88bd97da](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=ap-southeast-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-88bd97da)
* ap-southeast-2: [ami-eb3542d1](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=ap-southeast-2#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-eb3542d1)
* ap-northeast-1: [ami-66233967](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=ap-northeast-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-66233967)

When you launch the instance, make sure to allow HTTP traffic through your EC2 firewall configuration/security group.  You should probably also check ```/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys``` and make sure previous keys from when the instances were created are not carried forward.

Some of the features of the server AMI are:
* Pre-configured with locations for all of the EC2 regions
* Will automatically start and stop test agents in regions as necessary to run tests
    * Default config limits Agents to 1 instance at a time in each region
    * Test agents will be terminated if they have been running for close to an hourly increment (since they are billed hourly) and haven't had work in the last 15 minutes
* Defaults to a headless instance requiring API keys and use through the API only
    * Can be overridden by specifying headless=0 in the user data configuration
* Can archive tests to S3 if a bucket is configured and provided through user data
* Automatically updates the server and test-agent code to the latest (hourly)
* Any settings can be specified or overridden through user data when first launching your new instance
* A default API key can be provided through user data which will be configured as a no-limit API key
    * Additional keys will need to be added manually to ```/var/www/webpagetest/www/settings/keys.ini```

Known issues:
* The lag time for starting new test agents can be as long as 10 minutes.
* S3 archiving does not currently re-use the EC2 key used for starting test agents.

To use the AMI you need to provide an EC2 key and secret (at a minimum) through user data when the instance is started.  Any other settings provided through user data will override existing settings in ```settings.ini``` when you start your instance the first time. After you have started your instance, user data will no longer change the settings (e.g. on ```stop``` and ```restart``` of your instance).

**Be sure to remove your key and secret from the user data of your instance for security.**

To change settings after launching your instance, ssh to the instance and manually edit the file:

```
  sudo vim /var/www/webpagetest/www/settings/settings.ini
```

then bounce nginx:

```
  sudo service nginx restart
```

note that agent creation is logged at:

```
  /var/www/webpagetest/www/ec2/log
```

Example user data:

```
ec2_key=AKIAJKP75OFSROV5GWEQ
ec2_secret=<secret for the key>
api_key=MyAPIKey
headless=0
```

The full list of settings that can be specified is in [settings.ini.sample](https://github.com/catchpoint/WebPageTest/blob/master/www/settings/settings.ini.sample)
