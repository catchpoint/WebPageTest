                        Opportunities are recommendations that are broken down into three categories:</p>

                    <p>For every opportunity, you will be presented with some combination of tips (suggestions for what to do to improve) and experiments (the ability to apply optimizations right within the WebPageTest sandbox). When you choose to run an experiment, WebPageTest applies the optimization in our sandbox environment and then runs a test (alongside a control test which uses our sandbox environment without applying the optimization), and presents you with results showing you how significant, or insignificant, the improvement was.
                    </p>
                    <p>Experiments are a paid feature and are only available to WebPageTest Pro subscribers.</p>
