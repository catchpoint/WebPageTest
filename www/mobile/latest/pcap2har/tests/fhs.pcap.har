Learning how the files on the system are organized is important to knowing how and\r\n        where software is installed, how it and the whole system are configured, where various information\r\n        is stored, and how all the pieces fit together. This document aims to help its reader learn how the\r\n        Linux filesystem is structured, by allowing them to explore it interactively while giving explanations\r\n        of what the reader is looking at.</p>\r\n        <p>Before the filesystem hierarchy was standardized, every Linux distributor put files wherever they wanted in\r\n        the hierarchy. There were a few conventions about naming and locations, but it was difficult to know\r\n        where to find something, documentation was hard to write, and everything was just a mess. Some Linux\r\n        people got together around 1993 and created a standard filesystem layout for Linux systems. This was\r\n        called the FSSTND (File System STaNDard), and was released in 1994. A few years later, they\r\n        collaborated with other people from BSD Unix to create a more broadly applicable standard, for not\r\n        only Linux but other Unixes and Unix-like systems (commonly called *nixes). This they called the\r\n        Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, or FHS. As of 2010, its latest version is 2.3, released in 2004 (FHS).</p>\r\n        <p>It has a faintly recursive structure, with certain names and structures repeated\r\n        and nested. Knowing what they mean allows one to get an idea of what a directory contains by its name and context. The FHS\r\n        separates shareable and non sharable files, and dynamic and static files, to allow them to be\r\n        organized and stored independently. It makes extensive use of\r\n        <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link\">symbolic links</a>, or symlinks, to enhance\r\n        flexibility by making files appear in more than one place; in many cases an actual file or symlink\r\n        to one are equally acceptable to the standard.</p>\r\n        <p>Frequently, the FHS seeks to specify not what files/directories should be present, but\r\n        simply where they should be found if they are present on the system. These files are described\r\n        in the standard as being \"required if the corresponding subsystem is installed.\" Here, they\r\n        are simply marked as \"optional\".</p>\r\n        <p>This document is aimed at intermediate beginners, with basic knowledge of how Linux works. It \r\n        uses the FHS as a base, and adds things that one is likely to find on a \"typical\" Linux system.\r\n        The reader is encouraged to poke around on his own system to see what's there.\r\n        The standard parts should also be applicable\r\n        to a BSD system, or any other FHS-compliant system. The standard and Linux-specific parts are both\r\n        distinguished. Angle-brackets (&lt;&gt;) are used to denote parts of filenames that need something\r\n        substituted in, like a name or number. A '*' will occasionally be used to denote a variable\r\n        substring in a filename, like in a shell wildcard.\r\n        Clicking on a filename will either expand or collapse its description and, if the file in question\r\n        is a directory, will also show its files and subdirectories. In addition to MLA-style references,\r\n        references will frequently be made to man pages, like df(1) or fstab(5). See the entry for \r\n        /usr/share/man for how to interpret those.</p>\r\n    </intro>\r\n\r\n    <file> <name>/</name>\r\n        <summary>The root directory for the entire virtual filesystem.\r\n            <a href=\"http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#THEROOTFILESYSTEM\">(standard)</a>\r\n        </summary>\r\n        <desc>\r\n            <p>The partition that the OS was booted from defines the contents of the root directory.\r\n            This partition must contain (at least) everything required to boot the system and/or restore\r\n            it from backups. This includes /boot, /bin, /sbin, and /lib at the least.</p>\r\n            <p>It's considered good practice to keep this partition small, moving large\r\n            directories like /usr, /var, and /opt to separate partitions. This helps isolate\r\n            disk corruption errors and makes the essential root partition less vulnerable to them.\r\n            Of course, these concerns don't apply as much to small home systems.\r\n            It may still be advisable to separate things with partitions, but you could just as\r\n            easily put everything in one partition.</p>\r\n        </desc>\r\n        <children>\r\n        \r\n            <file> <name>bin</name>\r\n                <summary>Essential programs (standard)</summary>\r\n                <desc>\r\n                    The name <tt>bin</tt>, wherever it appears, means that the folder in question\r\n                    contains programs, either binary executables or scripts.
